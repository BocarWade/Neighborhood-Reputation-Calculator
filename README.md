# Neighborhood-Reputation-Tool
The Neighborhood Reputation Tool provides a scalable way to measure neighborhood reputations by analyzing sentiment in media content over time.My be a useful tool for researchers, policymakers, and urban planners uncover trends in public perception, revealing how factors like ethno-racial composition and historical biases shape neighborhood status.

Neighborhood Sentiment Analysis
Overview
This repository provides a Neighborhood Sentiment Analysis tool that allows users to calculate and analyze the reputation of neighborhoods based on sentiment extracted from text-based data (e.g., newspaper articles). The goal is to empower others to evaluate the sentiment and perception of specific neighborhoods in their cities by leveraging pre-trained sentiment models.

The project uses VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to analyze the sentiment of individual articles, then aggregates these scores to provide insights into neighborhood reputation trends over time.

Features
Sentiment Analysis: Evaluates the sentiment of articles using VADER.
Neighborhood-Level Insights: Aggregates scores to assess the sentiment for specific neighborhoods.
Historical Sentiment Trends: Provides tools to analyze how sentiment changes over time (e.g., per year).
Statistics and Reporting: Includes functions for calculating averages, counts, and other statistics to help users understand their data.
How It Works
The workflow consists of:

Reading Input Files: Accepts CSV files containing articles, each with text and date columns.
Sentiment Scoring: Uses VADER to analyze the sentiment of each article.
Aggregation: Computes average sentiment scores for each year and neighborhood.
Exporting Results: Saves neighborhood-level sentiment data to pickle files for future analysis.
Visualization: Provides tools for graphing yearly sentiment trends.

Usage
Prepare Data: Place your input files (CSV) under the data/ directory. Each CSV should contain a text column for the article content and a date column (formatted as YYYY-MM-DD).
Run the Script:
bash
Copy code
python neighborhood_analysis.py
Output:
Sentiment scores for individual articles are saved in the Sentiment_Scores_Final/ directory.
Yearly sentiment scores are saved in Date_Scores_Final/.
Yearly sentiment counts are exported to yearly_counts.csv.
Example Input CSV Structure
text	date
"Midtown is vibrant, but can be noisy."	2022-04-12
